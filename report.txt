Statistics prove that being happy while working is something most succesful people have in common.The signs of happiness detected in this session were less than the average value.
            
            Here are few stips to stay happy while waorking:
            
            1 Set a schedule.
                When you work from home, it is tempting to sleep late and then work until whenever, but this is not the path to productivity. Our brains like regularity, so set your alarm clock to get up at the same time every day (preferably early).
            
            2 Make social plans for after work.
                Working from home has huge benefits, but let’s face it—you get a little lonely. If you are going to go on social media, schedule it into your day, such as “10 am: 5 min. Facebook break.” This will help you stay balanced.
                
            3.Take advantage of not being in office:
               You get to be in your happy place all day, so make the most of it. With no coworkers to quibble over your musical taste, you can play tunes in the background while you work.
